<br />
<p>I am really looking forward to this class because I know learning more about C# will help me with both my career as a developer and with my game development hobby.</p>

<p>Here are my top 3 jobs that I want to pursue:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Web Developer</li>
    <li>Software Developer</li>
    <li>Data Analyst</li>
</ol>
